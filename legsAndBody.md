1   | Take the 2nd outer leg that is still connected to the skein (the one you just finished), and the adjacent inner leg in its intended position. Sc around on the outer leg until the position is as close to the inner leg as it can be. Then sc into the inner leg and sc in the next 3 sts on the inner leg (4 sts total). Then take the next inner leg and in its intended position, sc into it exactly as the first inner leg, connecting it to the others. Then take the last leg (outer) and sc into it around all 8 sts. Sc into the next 4 sts on the first inner leg, the second inner leg, and finally crochet 4 sc into the last 4 sts on the initial leg you started on. | 32
