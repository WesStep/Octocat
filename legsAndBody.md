*Close with sl st.

*On second outer leg, do NOT close with a sl st. Instead, position the legs how you want them to be, side-by-side. Then start with
 the body instructions below:

# Body:

R 1: Take the 2nd outer leg that is still connected to the skein (the one you just finished), and the adjacent inner leg in its
     intended position. Sc around on the outer leg until the position is as close to the inner leg as it can be. Then sc into the
     inner leg and sc in the next 3 sts on the inner leg (4 sts total). Then take the next inner leg and in its intended position,
     sc into it exactly as the first inner leg, connecting it to the others. Then take the last leg (outer) and sc into it around
     all 8 sts. Sc into the next 4 sts on the first inner leg, the second inner leg, and finally crochet 4 sc into the last 4 sts
     on the initial leg you started on. This makes the first round of the body. 32 sts, or 8 sts/leg

R 2: sc around. 32 sts

*** Stuff each leg individually to your liking ***

R 3: (sc in next 2 sts, sc2tog (dec) in next 2 sts) * 8. 24 sts

R 4: (sc in next st, sc2tog (dec) in next 2 sts) * 8. 16 sts

R 5:
